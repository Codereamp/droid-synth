# Android Synth app ( + Touch Drag Scroll, Package rename)
The branch is the extension to the [droid-synth](https://github.com/maks/droid-synth) project. It implements Touch Drag Scroll feature for the on-screen piano keyboard + package ranaming to `com.codereamp.synthesizer` for testing purpuses so the apk made from this source might co-exist with `com.manichord.synthesizer` apk on the device. The [droid-synth](https://github.com/maks/droid-synth) project currently is not going to be regulary updates [according to the developer](https://github.com/maks/droid-synth/issues/15) so if the feature is not merged, anyone can use this project for evaluation
